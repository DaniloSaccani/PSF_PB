# Learning-Based Control via Predictive Safety Filters

This repository contains the code used to generate the numerical example in the paper  
**"Learning-Based Control via Predictive Safety Filters"**

The experiment is an inverted pendulum with:
- hard state and input constraints,
- a moving obstacle that must be avoided,
- a **Predictive Safety Filter (PSF)** that guarantees safety and convergence,
- a learned **performance-boosting policy** (the "actor") that tries to improve performance while remaining safe.

**Key idea:**
- The learned policy does **not** directly control the plant.
- Instead, it proposes  
  1. a desired input \(u_L\), and  
  2. a scheduling knob \(\rho_t\) that sets how aggressively the PSF enforces Lyapunov decrease.
- The PSF takes these proposals, solves a short-horizon constrained optimal control problem, and returns a **safe input** that can actually be applied.
- This guarantees stability and constraint satisfaction at all times, even while learning.

This repository reproduces:
- closed-loop trajectories,
- the paper plots (pendulum angle vs. time, cost \(J^\star\)),

## Quickstart: Train and Log a Run

1. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies required by `run.py` (PyTorch, NumPy/SciPy, Matplotlib, CasADi, etc.).

2. From the project root, run:
```bash
python run.py
```

3. This will:
- train the learning-based controller in closed loop with the Predictive Safety Filter,
- create a timestamped folder under `results/`,
- save logs, rollouts (`rollout_*.npz`), and model checkpoints (`model_best.pth`, `model_latest.pth`).

The created directory under `results/` is referred to below as `RUN_FOLDER_NAME`.

## Generate the Paper Figures

After you have a trained run in `results/<RUN_FOLDER_NAME>/`, you can recreate the figures used in the paper.

1. Open `plot_results.py` and set:
```python
RUN_FOLDER_NAME   = "PSF_SSM_NS_..."   # the folder created by run.py
THETA0            = ...               # initial angle for evaluation
LEARNED_RHO_MODE  = "scheduled"       # or "fixed"
RHO_FIXED         = 0.5               # baseline PSF convergence rate
```

2. Run:
```bash
python plot_results.py
```

3. The script will:
- rebuild the **baseline PSF-only controller** (fixed ρ),
- rebuild the **learned controller + PSF** (scheduled ρ),
- simulate both from the same initial condition,
- save publication-style figures to:
```text
results/plots/theta_closed_loop.pdf
results/plots/cost_J.pdf
```

4. Copy them into the `figures/` folder:
```bash
cp results/plots/theta_closed_loop.pdf figures/
cp results/plots/cost_J.pdf figures/
```

- `theta_closed_loop.pdf` shows the closed-loop pendulum angle \(\tilde\theta(t)\) with the obstacle’s “forbidden band”.
- `cost_J.pdf` shows the evolution of a Lyapunov-like cost/value \(J^\star\), where the learned controller may temporarily increase the cost to safely route around the obstacle and then still converge.

## Generate the Pendulum GIF

You can also generate an animation of the pendulum avoiding the moving obstacle.

1. Open `create_gifs.py` and set:
```python
RUN_FOLDER_NAME   = "PSF_SSM_NS_..."   # same trained run
THETA0            = ...               # initial angle to visualize
LEARNED_RHO_MODE  = "scheduled"
RHO_FIXED         = 0.5
```

2. Run:
```bash
python create_gifs.py
```

3. The script will simulate one rollout of the learned controller + PSF and save:
```text
results/gifs/pendulum_single.gif
```

4. Copy it into `figures/`:
```bash
cp results/gifs/pendulum_single.gif figures/pendulum.gif
```

This GIF is the one embedded at the top of the README.
